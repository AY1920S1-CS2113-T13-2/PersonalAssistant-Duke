* This is an application intended for nurses within hospitals--particularly nurses with many patients under their care. Users will be able to navigate the program through either the GUI or CLI, according to their own preferences.
* Dukepital's purpose is to provide an organizational tool for these users, allowing them to categorize tasks/information based on their patients. This encourages timeliness and higher quality of provided care.
* Dukepital is written in OOP fashion. It provides a reasonably well-written code example that is significantly bigger (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
